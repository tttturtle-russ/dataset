The exploit involves crafting a very long input line to trigger the overflow.\nPerl Script: The perl command is used to generate a very long string consisting of the character \"x\" repeated \n2\n31\n2 \n31\n  times (which is a very large number, specifically 2,147,483,648 characters).\n\nPipe to Grep: This long string is then piped into the grep command, which searches for the character \"x\" within the string.\n\nOutput Redirection: The output of the grep command is redirected to /dev/null to discard it, as we are only interested in the processing of the input rather than the output."
