The vulnerability is triggered by passing a large size and offset to the buffer function, causing the buffer to read beyond its intended boundaries.\nBytearray Creation: The bytearray a is initialized with the string 'CVE request'.\n\nBuffer Creation: The buffer function is called with sys.maxsize as both the size and offset. This large size and offset trigger the integer overflow in the buffer function.\n\nPrint Memory Content: The code attempts to print the first 8192 bytes of the buffer, which can include sensitive information from the process memory."
