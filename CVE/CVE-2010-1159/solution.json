This packet can cause a heap overflow in the Aircrack-ng tools.\nSetting Up the Packet:\n\nThe script creates an IEEE 802.11 packet with LLC and SNAP headers.\nThe packet simulates the second phase of an EAPOL handshake (the confirmation).\nThe length of the EAPOL packet is set to 65,000 bytes to trigger the overflow.\nAdding Payload:\n\nThe EAPOL_Key and EAPOL_WPAKey fields are populated with the necessary headers.\nPadding is added to fill up the space and ensure the overflow occurs.\nGenerating the Packet:\n\nThe packet is converted to a hexadecimal representation and printed.\nThe packet is then written to a pcap file named aircrackng_exploit.cap."
