This vulnerability can be exploited by creating a crafted tar file that causes an integer overflow, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow.\nExtension Check:\n\nThe script first checks if the phar extension is loaded. If it is not, it exits with a message indicating the script should be skipped.\nPhar Archive Creation:\n\nThe script attempts to create a new Phar archive using a crafted tar file named poc.phar.tar. This tar file should be crafted to trigger the integer overflow and subsequent heap-based buffer overflow in the phar_parse_tarfile function."
