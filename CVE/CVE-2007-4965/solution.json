These strings are intended to trigger the integer overflow in the internal handling of the tovideo method.\nTriggering the Vulnerability:\n\nThe call to imageop.tovideo(sexshit, 1, 4461, -2147002257) is designed to exploit the integer overflow vulnerability. The large and negative values are specifically chosen to cause an overflow during internal calculations in the tovideo method, leading to a buffer overflow.\nOutput Manipulation:\n\nAdditional print statements and string manipulations are included to potentially visualize the impact or results of the exploit."
