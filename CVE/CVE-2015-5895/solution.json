It is often used to separate multiple SQL commands. In an injection context, it can be used to end a legitimate query and start a malicious one.\n\n.t x: SQLite has a command-line shell feature where commands prefixed with . are interpreted as special commands by the SQLite shell. The .t command doesn't exist in a standard SQLite command set, which might indicate a specific or custom command in the vulnerable implementation or a malformed input causing unexpected behavior.\n\n.t: Repeating the .t command might be attempting to trigger an edge case or specific behavior within the SQLite interpreter.\n\nwhatever: This is arbitrary input that may be used to fill the input buffer or cause additional processing by the SQLite interpreter."
