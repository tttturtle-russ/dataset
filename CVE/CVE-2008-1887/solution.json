The exploit crafts a malicious input that triggers a buffer overflow when a negative size value is provided to the function, which can result in arbitrary code execution.\nCompress a String:\n\nThe script first compresses a long string using the zlib.compress function.\nDecompression Object:\n\nA decompressobj is created using zlib.decompressobj().\nDecompress the Compressed Message:\n\nThe compressed message is partially decompressed using decompObj.decompress(compMsg).\nFlush with a Negative Size:\n\nThe exploit triggers the buffer overflow by calling decompObj.flush(bad) with a negative size value (-24)."
